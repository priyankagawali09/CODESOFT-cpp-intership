## 📄 Description:
This is a simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows two players to play against each other. The game uses a 3x3 grid, where players take turns entering their moves as "X" and "O". The board updates after each move, and the game checks for a win, draw, or continues if moves are still possible.

- Player Input: Prompts player to enter position (1–9).
- Update Board: Places player’s move on the board.
- Check for Win: Verifies if the current player has won.
- Check for Draw: Determines if the game ends in a draw.
- Switch Players: Alternates turns between "X" and "O".
- Display Result: Shows win/draw result after each game.
- Play Again: Option to restart the game after one ends.
